            <p>
                Maintaining Utmost Efficiency: This order acknowledges the necessity for effective command and control, but draws a clear line between legitimate authority and abusive power. It emphasizes that seniority and position held confers responsibility, not license for personal gain or mistreatment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Culture of Accountability: The emphasis on reporting procedures and disciplinary action fosters our culture of accountability, where misconduct is not tolerated and individuals are held responsible for their actions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In closing, please note that this general order does not outline specific disciplinary actions or sanctions for any misdemeanor. All matters requiring action/disciplinary action will be referred to the disciplinary committee and by extension, the Lodge LEK and the LKK, for the purpose of ethical consultations that agrees and conforms with the principles and standards of our community, which will convene to assess the severity of each infraction before any final sanctions or disciplines are determined.
